# PEON - War Table

## The Easy Game Server Manager

### [Peon Project](https://github.com/the-peon-project/peon)

An **OpenSource** project to assist gamers in self deploying/managing game servers.\
Intended to be a one-stop-shop for game server deployment/management.\
If run on a public/paid cloud, it is architected to try minimise costs (easy schedule/manage uptime vs downtime)\

### Peon Plans

This is the repo of the generic tools used to deploy game servers.

A default organisation has been made for official game server plans will be hosted at [Peon War Plans](https://github.com/peon-war-plans)

### Architecture/Rules

1. Only scripts/code to be store here. Large file pulls should be done from other sources.
2. Attempt to keep the code pool as generic as possible to maximize code re-use/supportability.
